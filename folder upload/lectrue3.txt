chat GPT has its own servers that they use for their Ai that allows any phone to use it

your email provider pays for your email service and allows you to freely use your email

ai costs electricity and therefor money to use but the providers are paying the cost to allow for market chare right now but that may change

some data that Ai pulls from is public but some is private and some is knowledge behind paywalls and when AI pulls from it problems can arise from the creators

Ai used thousands of public Youtube videos to learn from without the creators knowledge

servers sap a lot of water from water lines and requires literal lakes to cool them down 

books are not public you must buy a book so when Ai use books and quotes from said books can get the ai provider in trouble

Ai companies do not want the Ai to be trained from itself because the Ai will essentially become polluted by AI slop and the cycle repeats
